# CORDIC Rotation

## Introduction
CORDIC rotation is another application of the CORDIC algorithm, used for rotating vectors in the complex plane.

## Theory
- **Principle**: Similar to vectoring, CORDIC rotation iteratively rotates the vector until it reaches the desired angle.
- **Angle Decomposition**: The desired rotation angle is decomposed into smaller angles, typically powers of two or multiples of Ï€/4.
- **Iteration**: At each iteration, the vector is rotated by the decomposition angle, and the angle error is updated accordingly.
- **Magnitude Preservation**: As in vectoring mode, CORDIC rotation also maintains the magnitude of the vector throughout the rotation process.

## Algorithm
1. **Input**: Cartesian coordinates (x, y) of the vector and the desired rotation angle.
2. **Initialization**: Set the initial values of the angle and the vector to the input angle and vector, respectively.
3. **Iteration**:
   - Rotate the vector by the decomposition angle.
   - Update the angle and adjust the magnitude of the vector.
4. **Termination**: Stop iterating when the angle error meets the desired precision.

## Implementation
CORDIC rotation can be implemented using similar techniques as CORDIC vectoring. It involves iterative operations on the input vector and can be efficiently implemented in both hardware and software environments.
