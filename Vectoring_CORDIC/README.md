# CORDIC Vectoring

## Introduction
CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) is an algorithm used for calculating various mathematical functions, including vectoring and rotation. In vectoring mode, CORDIC computes the magnitude and phase angle of a vector.

## Theory
- **Basic Principle**: CORDIC operates by iteratively rotating a vector until it aligns with the desired direction.
- **Rotation Angles**: At each iteration, CORDIC rotates the vector by a predetermined angle based on the current angle error.
- **Vector Magnitude**: Simultaneously, CORDIC scales the vector to converge its magnitude to unity.
- **Iteration**: The process continues iteratively until the angle error reduces to an acceptable threshold.

## Algorithm
1. **Input**: Cartesian coordinates (x, y) of the vector.
2. **Initialization**: Set the initial values of the angle and the vector to the input angle and vector, respectively.
3. **Iteration**:
   - Compute the quadrant angle correction and rotate the vector by the correction angle.
   - Update the angle and scale the vector by a predetermined factor.
4. **Termination**: Stop iterating when the angle error reaches the desired precision.

## Implementation
CORDIC vectoring can be efficiently implemented in hardware or software. It involves a series of shift-add operations and can achieve high accuracy with relatively low computational complexity.
